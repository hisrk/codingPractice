    //Scenario: Data Processing Pipeline for Online Bookstore
    //
    //Imagine you're developing an application for an online bookstore that sells a wide variety of books. The application needs to handle various data processing tasks efficiently, such as filtering books by category, calculating total sales revenue, and finding the best-selling authors.
    //
    //Question:
    //Given a collection of Book objects representing books in the bookstore, design a data processing pipeline using Java 8 features,
    // including the Stream API, to perform the following tasks:
    //
    //Filter books by a specific category (e.g., Fiction, Science, History).
    //Calculate the total sales revenue generated from the filtered books.
    //Identify the top three best-selling authors based on the number of books sold.
    //Additional Details:
    //
    //Each Book object contains the following attributes:
    //Title
    //Author
    //Category
    //Price
    //Number of Copies Sold
    //Assume that the collection of Book objects is stored in a List<Book> named books.
    //Expected Output:
    //
    //For Task 1: A filtered list of books that belong to the specified category.
    //For Task 2: The total sales revenue generated from the filtered list of books.
    //For Task 3: The names of the top three best-selling authors.
